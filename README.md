enables traders to interact with liquidity providers, who set their own
prices and terms for each transaction.

    greater flexibility and customization options. Traders can negotiate
    prices, leverage, and other trading conditions directly with

    allowing traders to access liquidity providers directly. This
    reduces potential delays and ensures faster execution of trades.
